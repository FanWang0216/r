## Description

This module introduces programming using R with a focus on manipulating and visualizing data, mainly using tools from the `tidyverse` collection of packages. Participants will set up a functional RStudio workflow, import and manipulate data, use function and loops, create data visualizations, and learn how to solve problems with their programming in a reproducible way.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

1. Understand how R fits into data science tools ecosystem
2. Import, describe, and manipulate datasets
3. Visualize patterns in data with a range of charts and plots
4. Diagnose and fix errors in R
5. Manage and deliver projects using R and related tools

## Assignments

Participants should review the [Assignment Submission Guide](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/blob/main/onboarding_documents/submissions.md) for instructions on how to complete assignments in this module.

There are two assignments in this module: 

1. [Assignment 1](./02_activities/assignments/assignment_1.qmd) Due **(FILL IN due date)** at 11:59 PM EST 
2. [Assignment 2](./02_activities/assignments/assignment_2.qmd) Due **(FILL IN due date)** at 11:59 PM EST

## Delivery of the Learning Module

This course includes approximately 20 hours of in-class instruction, and 8 hours of optional but highly recommended work periods.

Learning sessions are scheduled **FILL IN dates and times**. During live learning sessions, the Technical Facilitator will introduce and explain key concepts and demonstrate core skills. Learning is facilitated during this time. Before and after each live learning session, the instructional team will be available for questions related to the core concepts of the module. 

Optional work periods are conducted **FILL IN dates and times**. Optional work periods are to be used to seek help from peers, the Learning Support team, and to work through the practice problems and assignments in the learning module, with access to live help. Content is not facilitated, but rather this time should be driven by participants. We encourage participants to come to these work periods with questions and problems to work through.  

Participants are encouraged to engage actively during the learning module. They key to developing the core skills in each learning module is through practice. The more participants engage in coding along with the instructional team, and applying the skills in each module, the more likely it is that these skills will solidify.

## Requirements

* Participants are not expected to have any coding experience; the learning content has been designed for beginners.
* Participants are encouraged to ask questions, and collaborate with others to enhance their learning experience.
* Participants must have a computer and an internet connection to participate in online activities.
* Participants must not use generative AI such as ChatGPT to generate code in order to complete assignments. It should be used as a supportive tool to seek out answers to questions you may have.
* **FILL IN installation of R and RStudio** 
* We expect participants to have completed the instructions mentioned in the [onboarding repo](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/).
* We encourage participants to default to having their camera on at all times, and turning the camera off only as needed. This will greatly enhance the learning experience for all participants and provides real-time feedback for the instructional team.

- We wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates. For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.
